### this document is a work in progress

#### api end point: http://api.aks-fast.com

Ask Fast offers a API framework that can create dialogs various medias type e.g sms, xmpp, email, twitter, voice and ussd. 

To get you message to the end user you can choose your favorite way of communicating, currently we support: sms, xmpp, email, twitter and voice. 
The API use web standard formats like jsons to make developingg as easy as posible. 

The API is split up two parts this documentation is about the ask fast api, the market place can be fount [here](http://docs.askfastmarketplace.apiary.io/)

The first part is the pure Ask Fast API, this allows you (the developer) to host you own questions and answers. This requires your own server and server sided  code. 

The second makes use of the Ask fast Marketplace. Here we do everything for you, so you do not have to worry about the server side. You can focus on what you do best creating great apps. Make your choose and get started!


## libraries

Library support is currently restricted to Java and PHP, if you have build your own library please let us know at: support@ask-fast.com. You can download the libraries from here, the manuals are in this document:

- [Java library](https://github.com/askfast/askfast-api-java)
- [PHP library] (https://github.com/askfast/askfast-api-php)

Api documentation for each labrary can be found on the github and bellow

## authentication

For authentication the Ask Fast API uses a unique token this token can be requierd with an oAuth request as descriped in the login section. To make sure the connection is save all calls have to be via a HTTPS connections regualar HTTP will fail.

## error handling

Ask Fast Api uses regular HTTP response codes to indicate suesses or fail of the API request. A 200 response indicates a succesfull request. The 4xx response often means an errer form the user side, this could be an invalid request or a not authorised (401).

Overview of HTTP response codes:

- 200 → everything whent smoothly.
- 400 → Bad request maybe a parameter is missing?
- 401 → Not authorised, the autosisation faild.
- 404 → Request not found.
- 5xx → internal server error, we try to make the error logs easy to read for you.


## dates

All dates are standard UNIX (epoch) coded. This represents the seconds passed since 01-01-1970. Some examples:

- 1396350000 - 12:00:00 01-01-2014
- 946728000   - 12:00:00 01-01-2000


## Pagination

At the moment the pagination limitations is a 1000 responses per call. If you wish to go back even further you can change the date attribute, to fetch the results for a certain period.  

## Rate limiting
The Ask Fast Api uses a fair use policy, when you do not abuse the system you do not have a rate limiting

## language codes

If you want to make a call and use Text To Speech (TTS) you can use the following language codes

|codes|langue|
|----|---|
|ca-es|Catalan|
|zh-cn|Chinese (China)|
|zh-hk|Chinese (Hong Kong)|

#group account

You can use the Ask Fast API, to directly talk to our servers to send messages. To send a questions this questions have to be hosted on your own server. This can be an easy mysql database or any other form of you liking.
If you do not want to host this your self you can use our Marketplace.

#group dialog senario

a Dialog-Scenario consists of Questions and answers hosted on a specific question url. These Question URLs must be accessible to the ASK-Fast Server. As response, these Questions can be sent as static string. 
In Order to facilitate ease of development, we have implemented an open-source library  to prepare questions, see *java library* and *PHP library*. 
Use of this library frees the developer from knowing how the Question should be formatted and also keeps it flexible to any changes in the Question format in the future. 

The dialog flow is as follows:

1. set up a dialog format and a callback url

2. initiate the dialog see `initiate dialog`

3. user responds

4. Answer is fetched

5. process the awnser

6. respond with the next question form `callback`

7. start again from point 3


The general format of a Question JSON looks like:

```json

            {
                "question_id":<some_id>,
                "question_text":"<text or url>",
                "type":"[ open | closed | comment | referral ]",
                "url":"<referral url>",
                "answers":[
                    { 
                        "answer_id":<some_id>,
                        "answer_text":"<text or url>",
                        "callback":"<url>"
                    }
                ],
                "event_callbacks":[
                    {
                        "event":"[answered|timeout|hangup|exception]",
                        "callback":"<url>"
                    }
                ],
                "media_properties": [
                    {
                        "medium": "[BROADSOFT | GTALK | SMS]",

# group java library

[Java library](https://github.com/askfast/askfast-api-java)

This a library to make it easy to build and send  dialog senario's.
Here is a short description of basic fuctions. An example can be found in the GitHub.

##### The following are the methods used in general to create a dialog of questions and answers. 
- `ask(“Question text”, nextURL)`

    QuestionType: OPEN

    Method used to ask a question. By default this function creates an OPEN question i.e open to user input. 

- `askByVoice(“Question text”, nextURL)`

    QuestionType: OPENAUDIO
    Method used to ask a open audio question. 
    
- `redirect(“to”, “redirectText”, “next”)`

    QuestionType: REFERRAL
    Method used to ask a open audio question. 

- `addAnswer(“Answer text”, “nextURL”)`

    QuestionType: CLOSED
    
    Sets question type as CLOSED and then adds an answer to an existing question. 
    
    say(“Response text”)
    
    QuestionType: COMMENT
    
    Sets the question type as COMMENT, method used to respond to a particular answer from the user.
    
    say(“Response text”, “nextURL”)
    
    QuestionType: COMMENT
    Method used to respond to a particular answer from the user. The nextURL is added as an answer to the question.

#### Initiating outbound communication requests:

Any outBound communication request works on the basis of oAuth 2.0 standard. For this to work, the following conditions must be met:

1. The instance variable of AskFast must be created with accountID and refreshToken. E.g: AskFast askfast = new AskFast(<url>, <accountID>, <refreshToken>, <params>);
2. Call the obtainAccessToken() method. This method will obtain the AccessToken from our keyserver.
    
- `outBoundCall( “fromAddress”, “toAddress”, “url” )`

    Initiates an outbound call (E.g. SMS, Phone call, XMPP message) based on the adapter keys provided while constructing the AskFast instance:
    
    AskFast(String url, String accountID, String refreshToken)
 
- `outBoundCall( “fromAddress”, “senderName”, “toAddress”, “url” )` 

    Performs a similar outbound call like #7, but for all text based outBoundCalls (E.g. Email, SMS, XMPP etc) will identify the sender by the senderName. 

- `outBoundCall( “fromAddress”, “senderName”, Collection<“toAddress”>, “url” )` 
    
    This initiates a broadcast call to all the addresses in the Collection.
    
- `outBoundCall( “fromAddress”, “senderName”, Collection<“toAddress”>, “url” )` 

    This initiates a broadcast call to all the addresses in the Collection.
    
- `outBoundCall( “fromAddress”, “senderName”, Map<“toAddress”, fMap<“ccAddress”, “ccName”>, Map<“bccAddress”, “bccName”>, “url” )` 

    This is usually used exclusively for email broadcast. Special parameters for ccAddress and bccAddress allows corresponding functionalities. 
    
- `render()` or `finish()`

    Method used to return the question thus formed in a JSON format.

#### To ease outBoundCall requests, make use of the outBoundCall() method in the ASK-Fast API.

- `outBoundCall( “adapterID”, “address”, “url” ) throws Exception`

    Initiates an outbound call (E.g. SMS, Phone call, XMPP message) based on the adapter keys provided while constructing the AskFast instance:
    `AskFast(String baseHostURL, String accountID, String refreshToken)`
